# Chess-Timer

Assumptions from the description:
- The clocks start with one of the players pressing their button to trigger the opponent's clock
- Alert will notify the winning player when one of the clocks reaches 0
- Both clocks will reset to 4 mins when a winner is notified


Assumptions I made:
- Simple UI
- I wasn't able to test it in Safari, but it was tested in modern Chrome, Firefox and Edge
- From "There should be one index.html file for us to load." I concluded the there should be only one file, no external .js files.
